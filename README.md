# LD_calculator
Storing code for linkage disequilibrium calculations 


The R script explains how simple two locus LD calculations were conducted. 
As of now, I have not uploaded the full iterative code, as it is a bit messy and not annotated.
I may upload later. If you would like to request it, email me @ hdk26@cornell.edu

Have a nice day. :)
